# DSI_Team6
Kick-off:

 Based on data write an actual exploration notes, the readme file
Write notes about analysis and define the business problem
We are trying to explore the customer base;
To predict unit price sensitivity, identify the high spenders
We are investigating whether price per unit affects the quantity purchased differently across age groups or genders.
younger vs older more sensitive to price changes
Quantity=β0​ + β1​*(Price per Unit) + β2*(Age Group) + β3​*(Gender) + β4*(Price per Unit*Age Group) + β5*​(Price per Unit*Gender) + ε
Explore the customer base of small to medium retail businesses;

Business Questions:
This project explores purchasing behavior for a small to medium-sized retail business. Our aim is to uncover how customer demographics and product attributes influence sales outcomes. Specifically, we seek to answer the following questions:
- Regression: Can we predict whether price per unit affects the quantity purchased differently across age groups or genders?
  → This helps us understand if certain customer segments are more or less price-sensitive.*
- Classification: Can we classify whether a customer will be a high spender based on their demographics (age, gender) and purchase details (product category, quantity)?
  → This insight could help businesses target or reward high-value customers more effectively.*

Tasks:
⦁	Iryna - the data exploration, feature engineering
⦁	 Imra - Conducting the regression model
⦁	Vrushali - Conducting the classification model
⦁	 Tetiana - conclusions, narrative maintenance
⦁	 Mandy - presentation
Deadlines:

By Tuesday - done with modeling and cleaning, exploration
From Tuesday - creating narrative;
 Saturday - presentation
